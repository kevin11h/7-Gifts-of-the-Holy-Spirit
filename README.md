Augustine: relation to the Beatitudes
Saint Augustine drew a connection between the gifts of the Holy Spirit and the Beatitudes (Matt.5:3-12).

+ Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven, reflects Fear of the Lord as the "poor in spirit" are the humble and God-fearing.

+ Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted, corresponds to the Gift of Knowledge, as for Augustine the knowledge of God brings both an increased awareness of personal sin, and to some extent grieving at the abandonment of practices and activities that separate one from God.

+  Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the land, relates to Piety.

+  Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied, pertains to Fortitude.

+  Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy demonstrates the Gift of Counsel.

+  Blessed are the clean of heart, for they will see God, the Gift of Understanding.

+  Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God, Wisdom.

+  Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
